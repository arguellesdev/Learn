EXAMPLE:
In the string "My name is %s and I am %d years old":

%s and %d are placeholders for string and integer values, respectively.

%s is used as a placeholder for a string value.
When the %s placeholder is used in a string,
it means that a string value will be inserted in its place.

%d is used as a placeholder for an integer value.
When the %d placeholder is used in a string,
it means that an integer value will be inserted in its place.
