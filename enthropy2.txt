you can create something but can dissapear at all 
Matter just change into other forms. 
Thermodynamics laws define the fundamental physical quantities like energy, 
temperature and entropy that characterize thermodynamic systems at thermal equilibrium.
These thermodynamics laws represent how these quantities behave under various circumstances.
The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if there are two bodies (A and B)
that are in thermal equilibrium with another body (third body as C) 
then these two bodies are also in thermal equilibrium with each another. 
 Since such a conclusion may seem trivial and easy to reach,
some may feel that it is not worth being one of the basic laws of thermodynamics.
