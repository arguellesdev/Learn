The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if there are two bodies (A and B)
that are in thermal equilibrium with another body (third body as C) 
then these two bodies are also in thermal equilibrium with each another. 
 Since such a conclusion may seem trivial and easy to reach,
some may feel that it is not worth being one of the basic laws of thermodynamics.
